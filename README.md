# Seattle Airbnb Datasets

### Project Description:
For this project, 
1. Come up with three questions I am interested in answering for Airbnb Seattle Datasets from Kaggle.
2. Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
3. Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.

The data is [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).

### Libraries Used:
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, NLTK

### Motivation:
・Describing something in your Airbnb page isn't necessary, but how much difference a number of reviews when you write or you don't write?  
・What vocaburaries are hosts write at description?  
・What percentage is null data in categorical data?  

### Files used in the project:
listings.csv - summary information contains name, host, location, description, url etc
